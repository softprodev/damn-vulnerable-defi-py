This repo contains the challenges from https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/index.html ported to Python/Brownie.

It is still a work in progress!

- Two challenges are incomplete
    - The Rewarder challenge
        - Need to find a way to "advance time" on the blockchain so rewards can be properly claimed. (Python/web3.py equivalent of https://docs.openzeppelin.com/test-helpers/0.5/api#time)
    - Compromised challenge
        - Need to find a way to load in the contracts from build-uniswap-v1 folder.
