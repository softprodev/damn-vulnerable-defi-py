This repo contains the challenges from https://www.damnvulnerabledefi.xyz/index.html ported to Python/Brownie.

It is still a work in progress!

Two challenges are incomplete
    - The Rewarder challenge
        -- Need to find a way to "advance time" on the blockchain so rewards can be properly dispersed
    - Compromised challenge
        -- Need to find a way to load in the contracts from build-uniswap-v1 folder.
